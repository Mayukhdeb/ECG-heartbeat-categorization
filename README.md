# ECG-heartbeat-categorization
## Using deep neural networks to predict heart rate anomalies from ECG data
The dataset was taken from kaggle.
### Stuff you'll find inside - 
* Visualisation of the frequency distribution of the categories in the raw training data
* Balancing the training data using augmentation which involves stretching and amplifying the data by a small factor 
* Simple deep neural network which gets trained upon the training data to get good accuracies.
* And a bit of me going into the details with the markdown within the notebook.
